    TODO -> get the pixels of a pathNode
            i want to show that a reading from DB can draw the pixels over our picture
            this way' it's kind of a way to show " i can read a mapped superMarket and i can read a path from DB"
            with this info i will show the customer how to go.

     Todo -> have a similar activity_grid , but have it over Frame Layout.
             There is a simple example in Meirav's slideshow of 'Android-1'


     Todo  ->      decide which pixel is "enter" (based on the picture)
                    manually put products on the picture (we will pre set it)
                    manually write a path of pixels between products
                    save this path to DB.

                    afterwards, we will read this path between this products.
                    and show it to the next customer.
